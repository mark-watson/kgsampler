# Knowledge Graph Sampler

Given a list of entity URIs from DBPedia, generate N-Triple data like the sample file `sample-KG.nt`.

Run sample program:

      (kgsampler::create-sample-KG)

Note: I used the free edition of GraphDB to load the N-Triple file and export to the Turtle
file `sample-KG.ttl` that I find easier to read.
